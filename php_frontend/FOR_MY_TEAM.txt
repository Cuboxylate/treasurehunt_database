Hey guys! To get the website working on your own ucpu logins:

1) Move the TreasureHunt folder into ~/lib/html on your ucpu drive
2) In the TreasureHunt_schema.sql file, near the bottom (before the big
   GRANT blocks) change the USER key from my unikey to your one
3) In TreasureHunt/include/config.ini, change the schema name to your
   unikey as well. DO NOT change the username and password - one of our
   extensions is to use this dummy user and grant it minimal rights over
   our schema.
4) Now to just make sure your database is set up. Go into PGAdmin, into your
   database, and run the TreasureHunt_schema.sql file in the magnifying glass
   thingy. 
5) Also run the TreasureHunt_ExampleData_v1.3.sql to fill your database with
   data.

You should now have a fully functional site at:
php.ug.it.usyd.edu.au/~UNIKEY/TreasureHunt

Have a look at it (an example login is still chunk and truffle) and see if
you see any errors or get any errors showing or anything. Have a look at the
files too if you want to see them and how they work together. We'll meet up
again next week to go through it before the final showing at our tutorial.

Thanks for all the work we've done together this semester :) it's been fun!
