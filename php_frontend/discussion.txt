Assumptions:

[*] Each time a correct waypoint is entered, score is increased by 1.
[*] A player's score statistic is not updated until the completion of a hunt.
[*] Every player has a score statistic - we don't need to check that it
    exists before updating it.
[*] Duration in the participates table is only entered upon completion of a
    hunt - not progressively with each visited waypoint.
[*] The full list of hunt details in the Broswe Hunts page is small enough to 
    be retrieved using PHPs fetchAll() function. If the size of the database
    grew we could easily change this to loop through fetch() calls.
[*] Any player can review any hunt, even if they haven't finished it. However,
    they can only review each hunt once.
[*] Hunt Status will display both the current hunt and the last completed hunt,
    whichever of them exists at the time.
