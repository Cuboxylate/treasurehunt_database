# Treasure hunt database schema and php front end

This was a group assignment done in two parts:

#### Our Schema
This folder contains a database schema we designed ourselves.
It is based around the idea of a Treasure Hunt service where 
players register themselves into a team and complete hunts,
moving through and validating waypoints, and accruing
points and achievements. We extended the basic requirements
by including challenge waypoints that can fork the 
progression of the hunt. There is also a UML diagram of the 
schema included.

#### PHP Front End
This folder contains a series of php web pages we authored
that interact with our hosted database. We were given a 
standardised schema to use for this portion, as well as some
skeleton php code. We implemented the majority of the php, 
including each of the database interaction functions in the php.
We also modified the database schema to add all of the internal
functions and the access modifiers.
The assignment handout pdf is included for reference.
